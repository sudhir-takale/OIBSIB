                    Porsche has used internal code numbers for each series of the 911.
                    All models have been marketed and sold as 911s.
                    The model series and associated internal codes are as follows:
                </h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>911 (1964–1989)</strong>
                        The Porsche 911 was developed as a much more powerful, larger, more comfortable replacement for
                        the
                        Porsche 356.
                        The new car made its public debut at the 1963 Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung, better known
                        to
                        English speakers as the Frankfurt Motor Show.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>930 (1975–1989) </strong>
                        The turbocharged version! The Porsche 930 is a sports car better known to the public as the 911
                        Turbo.
                        It was the maker's top-of-the-range 911 model for its entire production duration and, at the
                        time of
                        its introduction, was the fastest production car available in Germany.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>964 (1989–1994)</strong>
                        Type 964 ("nine-sixty-four", or "nine-six-four") is Porsche's internal code name for the 911
                        Carrera
                        2 and 911 Carrera 4 models,
                        which were badged simply as "Carrera 2" and "Carrera 4"."964" is used by automotive publications
                        and
                        enthusiasts to distinguish them from other generations of the Carrera
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>993 (1995–1998)</strong>
                        The last air-cooled 911!
                        The Porsche 993 is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 model replacing the 964. Its
                        discontinuation marked the end of air-cooled 911 models.
                        The 993 was much improved over and quite different from its predecessor. According to Porsche,
                        every
                        part of the car was designed from the ground up,
                        including the engine and only 20% of its parts were carried over from the previous generation.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>996 (1999–2004)</strong>
                        All-new body and water-cooled engines!
                        The Porsche 996 is the internal designation for the 911 model manufactured from 1997 until 2006.
                        It was replaced by the 997 in 2004 but the high performance Turbo S, GT2 and GT3 variants
                        remained
                        in production until 2006.
                        The 996 had little in common with its predecessor, with the first all new chassis platform since
                        the
                        original 911 and a new water-cooled engine.
                        Technically, it was a major change, a complete breakthrough from the original car other than the
                        overall layout.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>997 (2005–2012)</strong>
                        The 997 was an evolution of the preceding 996, with the most significant changes being interior
                        and
                        exterior styling,
                        the most notable being the replacement of the "fried egg" headlamps used on the 996 with the
                        classic
                        "bug eye" units.
                        Larger 18-inch wheels were fitted as standard, and other engineering changes include slightly
                        increased power; however,
                        the car is technically very similar to its predecessor. A new S version was offered, with
                        additional
                        power from a slightly larger engine, sports suspension, and sports exhaust.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>991 (2012–2019)</strong>
                        All New Body! The Porsche 991 is the internal designation for the seventh generation of the
                        Porsche
                        911 sports car,
                        which was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show on 15 September as the replacement for the
                        997.
                        The 991 was an entirely new platform, only the third since the original 911 launched in 1963
                        (the
                        996 of 1999 was the second new platform).
                        Production of the 991 generation ended on December 20, 2019, with 233,540 units produced.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>992 (2019-Onwards)</strong>
                        The 992 uses rack-and-pinion steering and has a MacPherson strut front suspension and a
                        multi-link
                        rear suspension.
                        Compared to its predecessor, the 992 is 45 mm (1.8 in) wider and now uses aluminium body panels.
                        The 992 also has a new rear bumper with larger exhaust tips than its predecessor.
                        The front of the car is designed to mimic the appearance of an early 911 in a modern fashion.
